## How do I login in development?

1. Start `lamdera live`
2. Click the login button on the homepage
3. Enter the email address in `Env.adminUser` (which is a@a.se)
4. Open your browser dev tools console. You should see an 8 digit login code. Type that in.
5. You're logged in!

After you've finished a feature, make sure to run elm-review and elm-test!
